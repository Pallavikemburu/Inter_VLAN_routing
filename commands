For a project involving Inter-VLAN routing in Cisco Packet Tracer, here are some key commands and steps:

1. Creating VLANs
First, you need to create VLANs on the switch:

    enable
    configure terminal
    vlan 10
    name Sales
    exit
    vlan 20
    name Marketing
    exit


2. Assigning Ports to VLANs
Assign switch ports to the created VLANs:

    interface range fa0/1 - 10
    switchport mode access
    switchport access vlan 10
    exit
    
    interface range fa0/11 - 20
    switchport mode access
    switchport access vlan 20
    exit


3. Configuring a Router for Inter-VLAN Routing
If using a router on a stick configuration, you need to create sub-interfaces for each VLAN:

    enable
    configure terminal
    interface gig0/0
    no shutdown
    ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0  // For VLAN 10
    exit
    
    interface gig0/0.10
    encapsulation dot1Q 10
    ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
    exit
    
    interface gig0/0.20
    encapsulation dot1Q 20
    ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
    exit


4. Configuring Default Gateway on Switch
Set the default gateway for the switch to ensure it can route traffic:

    enable
    configure terminal
    ip default-gateway 192.168.10.1  // Use the router's IP address
    exit


5. Testing Connectivity
You can then test connectivity between the VLANs using the ping command from a connected PC:
    
    ping 192.168.20.1  // Testing connection to VLAN 20


6. Verifying Configuration
To verify the VLANs and trunking:

    show vlan brief              // Show VLANs
    show ip interface brief       // Show interfaces and their IPs
    show running-config           // Show the running configuration



•This project focuses on configuring Inter-VLAN routing in Cisco Packet tracer, enabling communication between
devices in different VLANs using a Layer 3 router.
•Demonstrates how to segment a network for better security and efficiency while maintaining seamless data flow between VLANs.
